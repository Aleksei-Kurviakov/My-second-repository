Disturbed - Decadance

[Verse 1]
Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy

[Chorus]
Then, you slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

[Verse 1 Reprise]
Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy

[Chorus]
Then, you slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

[Bridge]
If I scare you now, don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see?
Said, if I scare you now, don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see?

[Chorus]
Then, you slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

[Outro]
Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?



Rammstein - Sonne
Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun, aus
 
Alle warten auf das Licht
Fürchtet euch, fürchtet euch nicht
Die Sonne scheint mir aus den Augen
Sie wird heut Nacht nicht untergehn
Und die Welt zählt laut bis zehn
 
Eins, hier kommt die Sonne
Zwei, hier kommt die Sonne
Drei, sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Vier, hier kommt die Sonne
 
Die Sonne scheint mir aus den Händen
Kann verbrennen, kann euch blenden
Wenn sie aus den Fäusten bricht
Legt sich heiß auf das Gesicht
Sie wird heut Nacht nicht untergehn
Und die Welt zählt laut bis zehn
