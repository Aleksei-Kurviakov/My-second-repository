Disturbed - Decadance

[Verse 1]
Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy

[Chorus]
Then, you slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

[Verse 1 Reprise]
Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy
